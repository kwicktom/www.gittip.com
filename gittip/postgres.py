"""This is a high-value abstraction layer over psycopg2.

All functionality provided by this module is bundled with psycopg2, this module
just configures it the way you want it. Here are the things we configure:

    - You can connect with URLs in addition to connection strings.
    - Connections are transparently pooled.
    - Calls are automatically isolated in transactions.
    - Cursors yield dictionaries, not tuples.

The main object is PostgresManager. Instantiate it with the following
parameters:

    dsn         A Postgres connection string (see http://www.postgresql.org
                /docs/9.1/static/libpq-connect.html) or an URL starting with
                "postgres://". [required]
    minconn     The minimum size of the connection pool. [1]
    maxconn     The maximum size of the connection pool. [10]

The resulting object gives you five methods for interacting with Postgres. The
first four take a string of SQL and a tuple of arguments to be used to replace
the instances of "%s" in the SQL string. Each call to these methods is isolated
in its own transaction. (XXX Are multiple statements in a single call wrapped
in a single transaction?)

    execute     Execute the query and discard the results.
    fetchone    Execute the query and return a single result or None.
    fetchall    Execute the query and return a results generator or None.
    get_cursor  Execute the query and return a context manager wrapping a
                 psycopg2 RealDictCursor. The connection underlying the cursor
                 will be checked out of the connection pool and checked back in
                 upon both successful and exceptional executions against the
                 cursor.
    get_connection  Return a context manager wrapping a db PostgresConnection.
                The manager turns autocommit off for you and then turns it on
                again when you're done with it. Use this when you need fine-
                grained transaction control.

Look at the first three methods for examples of how to use get_cursor.
